#This should print the plot with the line along but it is not showcasing the line 

#Part B-B
#Interpretting the regression model: It seems as though
#there is a corelation between the results of Budget
#and The days taken to create the fuill project in games development.
#There are twom major outliers where the two middle ground
#budgets actually take both the shortest and the longest
#amount of time out of all of the projects which is a fun
#little data observbation. It does apper as though the games
#with higher budgets get amde faster which may be because 
#talent is getting paid more or because they have 
#more resources to expend on the project

#Part B-C
#  I know from looking at tutorials and other data pieces
# (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY5xMgBQsOU 
# and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mGXnm0fHtI&t=634s)
# that the linear regression test is very reliable and 
# good for data analytics but unfortunately I don't believe
# that I have done mine correctly as my line is not drawing
# on the graph. The data is all there when I rpint the
# summary but it is not showing on the plot which is 
# incredibly frustrating. As I mentioned before that 
# there are two massive outliers in my data as the two
# middle projects take the longest and shortest amounts
# of time in comparison to the budget which is a fun 
# data fact that I thought was interesting.
