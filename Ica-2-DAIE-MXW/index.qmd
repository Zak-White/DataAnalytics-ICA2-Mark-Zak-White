     abline(Regression),
     xlab = "Budget", ylab = "DaysInDifference")
#This should print the plot with the line along but it is not showcasing the line 

#Part B-B
#Interpretting the regression model: It seems as though
#there is a corelation between the results of Budget
#and The days taken to create the fuill project in games development.
#There are twom major outliers where the two middle ground
#budgets actually take both the shortest and the longest
#amount of time out of all of the projects which is a fun
#little data observbation. It does apper as though the games
#with higher budgets get amde faster which may be because 
#talent is getting paid more or because they have 
#more resources to expend on the project

#Part B-C
#  I know from looking at tutorials and other data pieces
# (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY5xMgBQsOU 
# and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mGXnm0fHtI&t=634s)
# that the linear regression test is very reliable and 
# good for data analytics but unfortunately I don't believe
# that I have done mine correctly as my line is not drawing
# on the graph. The data is all there when I rpint the
# summary but it is not showing on the plot which is 
# incredibly frustrating. As I mentioned before that 
# there are two massive outliers in my data as the two
# middle projects take the longest and shortest amounts
# of time in comparison to the budget which is a fun 
# data fact that I thought was interesting. 


#Part E: Quality and Conclusion
#                           Document Formatting
#I would like to quickly comment on the structure of the report. I feel like my report
#is structured well and it is easy to see what everything is as I have comments above 
#each question to show what it is and explain a little bit of what it does. The tables
#themseleves are very clear as I only print out the nessesary values on each table for 
#each question. I feel like the webpage itself is not formattted the best but I really
#tried my best and I just didn't really understand it.

#                           Suitability of Tables:
#This will be short as I feel like all of my tables hit all of the breifs points here and
#I see not issues with what I created in terms of the tables. They are all clear to read
#and shows the relvant data

#                           Suitability of Plots:
#I only use one plot in this project and I believe it is suitable for what I am attempting to do.
#The main issue with my plot is that the abline is not working correctly so i feel like I may
#have done the linear regression wrong even though I followed the linked tutorials and also 
#created what I thought would be suitable data. It also appears as I am wrting this down that 
#I misread the question and have used incorrect data instead of the team size but it is to
#late for me to go back and change it at this stage.

#           Adherence to Best Practices in Coding and Data Visualization:
#I will keep this short. I believe that I manage to keep my code nice, neat and Ledgible.


#                           Conclusion and Reflection:
#In starting my conclusion i am going to emntion that I found this very hard. Much harder
# than I had anticipated and as such I have ended up having to leave out an entire section of
# the brief much to my own frustration. I have no idea why I struggled with this so much as I
# thought I had a good grasp of the concepts following the exam and the GCA both of which I belive
# I have done well in.
# 
# I believe that I have done part A well and have answered most if not all the questions suffiecently
# Part B is up in the air as to wether any of the work is salvadgable. I believe that I was acting on
# sound logic after researching it online but I cannot know right now as it does not appear to be working.
# 
# Despite my frustrations with this project There was a great feeling of accomplishment when I even
# got a question half working or when I troobleshot a line of code. This did make me feel good and
# that I may be able to figure this stuff out.
# 
# Even though I admit I struggle with the module I do find it interesting and I do think that it has a space
# in the wider games development industry. As some of the queries show not only can it show you correlation
# between budgets and other factors it can also allow the developers to round up and analys feedback so much
# easier than without it. Using data Tables or even databases is very useful for finding out information like
# player data and preferences. It also can tell you the close relationship between factors that you might not
# even consider as a project planner or as a developer to a player feedback. 
# 
#I was also struggling and extremely stressed during the course of this rpoject and
#while I am not trying to excuse the lack of progress in the CA I am hoping that 
#this clarifies and explains that I was not wroking at maximum efficency 
#due to otuside circumstances
#
# Overall while I am furstrated with my result I feel like the project was a good learning point for me as a person as I have started to learn a skill in rsql and data analyasis and even if I am not good at it now with time and practise I can always imrpove. It is a shame that I didn't plan this out well enough to do part C at all
