About this site

```{r}
# The Technology Exploration that I utilised is in a few 
# of the packages that I needed to use for completing
# the queries in part A. The new ones as far as I am aware
# are: Stringr and Lubridate both of which I use for some
# of the queries that I create in part A. The main functions
# of Lubridate seem to be with the changing of date formatting
# (atleast this is how I used it) to fit in with the diff time 
# function that comes prepackaged with R. 
# 
# Stringr on the other hand I use less often but it comes packaged 
# with a function that allows me to directly count how many times a 
# string has shown up that I try to use for a question in part A. 
# I believe my logic in answering that question was correct but it
# might be my exectution that was off.
